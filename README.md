## Description

This library was created with the aim of making it easy to program stm32 microcontrollers.
It is based on the C++ language in an object-oriented context
and the HAL API.
Several optimizations have been applied to improve the storage and execution speed of the MCU, through the use of DMA.
Drivers have been developed for certain number of sensors/actuators and network modules.
This code is tested with pseudo unit tests, made based on the UART serial communication protocols.
